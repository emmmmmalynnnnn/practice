      <p2>A little about Neptune...
          Neptune operates through the visual and loves to help us merge with our surroundings. We can feel drowned by Neptune's subtle power. It is hard to define as it is has no boundaries but spills from one space to the next.
          Neptune overseas our dreams and caters to some of our spiritual pursuits. A strong Neptunian influence in Astrology indicates a connection to the other side and spirits from other worlds.
          Neptune helps nuture our imaginations while creating illusions of what is real and what is not. We tend to get lost in the loose seductive grip Neptune provides.
          May Neptune's sublime power help us explore new dimensions in space.</p2>
